# Grade-Wise Videos

Place your grade-specific videos in the following structure:

```
grade-wise/
  grade1/
    grade1.mp4 (or your video filename)
  grade2/
    grade2.mp4
  grade3/
    grade3.mp4
  grade4/
    grade4.mp4
  grade5/
    grade5.mp4
  grade6/
    grade6.mp4
  grade7/
    grade7.mp4
  grade8/
    grade8.mp4
```

## Notes:
- Video files should be named according to the grade (e.g., `grade1.mp4`, `grade2.mp4`, etc.)
- Or you can use any filename and update the `gradeVideoFiles` object in `mini-modules/page.tsx`
- Supported formats: MP4, WebM
- Recommended: Use MP4 (H.264) for best browser compatibility
